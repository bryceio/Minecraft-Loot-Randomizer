# Minecraft Loot Randomizer
 Randomizes Minecraft's loot tables.


# Use Instructions
 To use this program, which you can either do via the provided exe file or by compiling the code yourself, you need to first obtain the loot tables that you want to randomize. These can be found in Minecraft's .jar file within .minecraft/versions/(version number) or within the .jar file of a mod you want to apply this to. Once you've opened the jar file, go to the data/minecraft (or data/mod_name) folder and copy the loot_tables folder out. Put this folder and your .exe file in the same place and run the exe file.
 
 Once you follow the above steps, you will have a randomized loot_tables folder. To use this, you will need to make it into and install it as a datpack on your world. There are plenty of tutorials for doing this online, so I will not go into depth on that process. Use the provided pack.mcmeta file generated by the program when making your datapack.
 
 If any issues arise while using this program, please let me know.
